# Code Notes: Employee Polls

## 06/12/2022

Starting today while working on Chirper App. Printed out slides with the sample pages to figure out my components. Then I coded my api. I used the api from the Chirper app as a guideline while looking at my data file. Now I am writing my first api. (Yay!) I did finish off coding the actions files.

Hi. I'm back again today. I'm trying to follow along with the Chirper app in structuring Employee Polls app. Now I am working on the hierarchy of my app components:

### Login Component

- App: container for the component;
  - Content Wrapper: wrapper for the content;
  - Header: title for the view;
  - Grid: formats content;
    - Form: dropdown with list of user accounts and login button;

Hi, I'm back. I'm still working on the **Login Component**.
So the hierachy for my Login page should be:

- Login
  - Login Header
  * Login Grid Layout
    - Brand Image
    - Login Form

Hi, I'm back. I'm really struggling with this project. I wonder if I should've started this React Nanodegree. I need to start over because I'm so confused.
